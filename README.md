# Quantify-This

The aim of the game is to answer the questions.
I have many stretch goals and idea's for it, but .. 
It is finally finished enough that I'll post it into the wild.

Some of the stretch goals are:

CSS overhaul!!!
Refactor and refine.
Hold previous session's high score, (would be the first to do, but requires some redesign)
More random question generators.
Tune the round times and points gifted accordingly.
Award more points, based off of how quick questions are answered.
Add in media-player/plugin so people can change tracks or listen to their own.
Make keyboard buttons correspond to game buttons.
More in-game sound effects and animations.


Please feel free to recommend/add too and use freely!
Share the Love :D
